# Exploring Bikeshare Dataset

This project was created in Sep.21.2023

## Description

In this project, I have used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Files used

- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

## The dataset

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

    Gender
    Birth Year
